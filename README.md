# Lights Off

Yet another one of those dark themes but slightly subtle color scheme. If any of the colors aren't of your taste, feel free to modify the theme.json file from my Github repo [here](https://github.com/deusv0lt/lights-off-vscode-theme). Hit F5 key with the file open to go into debug mode and be creative.
